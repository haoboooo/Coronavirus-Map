# This three files are used to deployed on a server.
# 1. So you firstly need to have a server with Linus system and download the environment of JVM and tomcat.
# 2. Then in the environment of the server, you need to deploy the JSP file "index.jsp" and "control.js" file in the directory "/www/server/tomcat/webapps/ROOT".
# 3. Any data you want to modify is in the index.jsp file and all the Front-Ended user interface and visual effect should be changed in the control.js.
# 4. Then you could run open a new web with address which is equivalent to your server address. You will see the map!!!:D
